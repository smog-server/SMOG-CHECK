README for smog-check. These are very simple scripts 
that will test to see if your installation of SMOG 2 is
generating CA and AA .top files that are consistent with 
the default settings. They also check to see if the 
model parameters can be adjusted properly.

SMOG-CHECK is free software, distributed under the GNU
General Public License. See COPYING.

			USAGE

There are three check scripts provided by this bundle. 
One script is very fast, one is very comprehensive and 
can be used to test new SMOG models that you may 
design. The third script will check the smog tools.

When everything works well, running the checks is 
fairly quick and easy.  Just make sure you run 
configure.smog2 for the version of SMOG 2 that you would
like to test, before running the tests.  Also, make sure
to launch smog-check from the smog-check directory.

For the less comprehensive check, issue the command:

./quick-check

For the comprehensive check (requires ~30 minutes): 

./smog-check 

If you would like to only perform a specific test, you
can indicate which test with

./smog-check N

where N is the test you would like to repeat.  This can 
be useful when debugging SMOG 2.

If you would like to only perform tests N to M, indicate 
which tests with

./smog-check N M


To check the that the smog tools are working properly, use:

./smog-tools-check

smog-tools-check is not very comprehensive, but it will 
ensure basic functionality of the tools.

These scripts have been tested on Linux and OSX 
platforms.
