README for the SMOG2 smog-check. This is a very simple 
script that will test to see if your installation of 
SMOG2 is generating CA and AA .top files that are 
consistent with the default settings.

			USAGE

When everything works well, all you need to do is issue 
the command

./smog-check 

The script assumes that perl is located at /usr/bin/perl 
and that sed and bash are in your path.

This script has been tested on Linux and OSX platforms.
If you are using alternate platforms, the most common
issue is that perl is located in a different directory
than expected.  If that is the case, you will want to
update the .pl files, such that the proper interpreter
is used.

Direct all questions to info@smog-server.org.
