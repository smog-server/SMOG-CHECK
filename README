README for the SMOG2 smog-check. These are very simple 
scripts that will test to see if your installation of 
SMOG2 is generating CA and AA .top files that are 
consistent with the default settings.

			USAGE

There are two check scripts provided by this bundle. 
One script is very fast, whereas the second is very 
comprehensive and can be used to test new SMOG models
that you may design.

When everything works well, running the checks is 
fairly quick and easy.  Just make sure you run 
config.bash before running the tests.

For the less comprehensive check, issue the command:

./quick_check

For the comprehensive check (may take ~30 minutes): 

./smog-check 

The scripts assumes that perl is located at 
/usr/bin/perl and that sed and bash are in your path.

These scripts has been tested on Linux and OSX 
platforms. If you are using alternate platforms, the 
most common issue is that perl is located in a different 
directory than expected.  If that is the case, you will 
want to update the .pl files, such that the proper 
interpreter is used.

Direct all questions to info@smog-server.org.
