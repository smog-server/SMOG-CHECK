README for smog-check. These are very simple scripts 
that will test to see if your installation of SMOG 2 is
generating CA and AA .top files that are consistent with 
the default settings. They also check to see if the 
model parameters can be adjusted properly.

SMOG-CHECK is free software, distributed under the GNU
General Public License. See COPYING.

			USAGE

There are two check scripts provided by this bundle. 
One script is very fast, whereas the second is very 
comprehensive and can be used to test new SMOG models
that you may design.

When everything works well, running the checks is 
fairly quick and easy.  Just make sure you run 
configure.smog2 for the version of SMOG 2 that you would
like to test, before running the tests.  Also, make sure
to launch smog-check from the smog-check directory.

For the less comprehensive check, issue the command:

./quick-check

For the comprehensive check (may take over an hour): 

./smog-check 

If you would like to only perform a specific test, you
can indicate which test with

./smog-check N

where N is the test you would like to repeat.  This can 
be useful when debugging SMOG 2.

These scripts have been tested on Linux and OSX 
platforms. 

Direct all questions to info@smog-server.org.
