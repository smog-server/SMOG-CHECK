README for the SMOG 2 smog-check. These are very simple 
scripts that will test to see if your installation of 
SMOG v2 is generating CA and AA .top files that are 
consistent with the default settings. They also check 
to see if the models can be adjusted properly.

SMOG-CHECK is free software, distributed under the GNU
General Public License. See COPYING.

			USAGE

There are two check scripts provided by this bundle. 
One script is very fast, whereas the second is very 
comprehensive and can be used to test new SMOG models
that you may design.

When everything works well, running the checks is 
fairly quick and easy.  Just make sure you run 
config.bash before running the tests.

For the less comprehensive check, issue the command:

./quick-check

For the comprehensive check (may take ~30 minutes): 

./smog-check 

These scripts have been tested on Linux and OSX 
platforms. 

Direct all questions to info@smog-server.org.
