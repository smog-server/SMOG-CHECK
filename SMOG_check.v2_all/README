README for SMOG2 tests.  This is a very simple script
that will test to see if your installation of SMOG2
is generating CA and AA .top files that are consistent
with the default settings.

			USAGE

When everything work well, all you need to do is issue 
the command

./smog-check <SMOG_BIN>

SMOG_BIN is the directory in which your installation 
of SMOG2 is located.

This script has been tested on Linux and OSX platforms.
If you are using altnerate platforms, the most common
issue is that perl is located in a different directory
than expected.  If that is the case, you will want to
update the .pl files, such that the proper interpreter
is used.

Direct all questions to info@smog-server.org.
